## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/planka-discord-notifier.git
cd planka-discord-notifier
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
4. Configure your environment variables in `.env` file (DO NOT commit this file):
   - `PLANKA_BASE_URL`: Your Planka server URL
   - `PORT`: Webhook server port (default: 3001)
   - `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`: Your Discord webhook URL
   - `BOARD_NAMES`: JSON object mapping board IDs to names
   - `LANGUAGE`: Language code (`en` or `hu`, default: `en`)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude it. Always use `.env.example` as a template and create your own `.env` file locally.

Example `.env` file structure (replace with your actual values):
```env
PLANKA_BASE_URL=https://your-planka-url.com
PORT=3001
LANGUAGE=en
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=your-discord-webhook-url
BOARD_NAMES={"board-id-1":"Board 1","board-id-2":"Board 2"}
```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
```bash
node index.js
```
2. Configure your Planka webhook URL to point to: `http://your-server:3001`
3. The server will automatically receive Planka events and forward them to Discord

### Language Configuration

The service supports multiple languages for Discord notifications. You can change the language by setting the `LANGUAGE` environment variable in your `.env` file:

```env
# For English
LANGUAGE=en

# For Hungarian
LANGUAGE=hu
```

If an unsupported language code is provided, the service will automatically fall back to English.

## Message Colors

Messages are color-coded based on event type:
- üü¢ Green: Creation
- üî¥ Red: Deletion
- üîµ Blue: Modification
- ‚ö™ Gray: Other actions

## Adding New Languages

To add a new language:

1. Create a new file in the `languages` directory (e.g., `languages/de.js` for German)
2. Copy the structure from `languages/en.js`
3. Translate all strings to the new language
4. Use the new language code in the `LANGUAGE` environment variable
